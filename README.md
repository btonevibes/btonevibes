# Rawls' Original Position Game

## Description

This game simulates John Rawls' "Original Position" thought experiment. You are a human embryo in space, about to land on Earth. Behind the 'Veil of Ignorance,' you don't know your future circumstances (e.g., wealth, health, social status).

You will be presented with pairs of fictional countries, each described by various societal statistics. For each pair, you must choose the country you would prefer to be born into, based *only* on the provided statistics. Your choices will help rank your preferences for different societal structures.

## How to Play

1.  You will see two country cards, each displaying statistics like life expectancy, median income, poverty rate, etc.
2.  Click the "Choose [Fictional Country Name]" button for the country you'd prefer.
3.  Repeat this for a set number of comparisons (currently 15).
4.  After all comparisons, your ranked preferences will be displayed.
5.  You can choose to "Play Again" to restart the game.
